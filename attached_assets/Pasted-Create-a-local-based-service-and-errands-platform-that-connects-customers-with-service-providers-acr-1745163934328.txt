Create a local-based service and errands platform that connects customers with service providers across all Namibian regions and towns. The app will allow users to book services based on hourly rates, pay using Namibian payment methods, and manage their bookings efficiently.

The platform will have three panels:

Admin Panel â€“ Full control over the platform, users, payments, and services.

Service Provider Panel â€“ For individuals and businesses offering errands, service skills, rentals, and other services. Each provider will have a profile, service area, pricing, and booking system.

Customer Panel â€“ Customers can browse, book, and pay for services, track bookings, and leave reviews.
